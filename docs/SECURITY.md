# NanoClaw Security Model

## Trust Model

| Entity | Trust Level | Rationale |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Main group | Trusted | Private self-chat, admin control |
| Non-main groups | Untrusted | Other users may be malicious |
| Container agents | Sandboxed | Isolated execution environment |
| Incoming messages | User input | Potential prompt injection |

## Security Boundaries

### 1. Container Isolation (Primary Boundary)

Agents execute in containers (lightweight Linux VMs), providing:
- **Process isolation** - Container processes cannot affect the host
- **Filesystem isolation** - Only explicitly mounted directories are visible
- **Non-root execution** - Runs as unprivileged `node` user (uid 1000)
- **Ephemeral containers** - Fresh environment per invocation (`--rm`)

This is the primary security boundary. Rather than relying on application-level permission checks, the attack surface is limited by what's mounted.

### Profile Boundary

NanoClaw now distinguishes between:
- `safe` profile: default posture for general installs
- `operator` profile: trusted personal-rig mode with stronger main-group privileges

The profile changes what the main group is allowed to mount. In `safe`, the main group does not get the real project root, the live `/app/src` bind mount, or Docker socket access by default.

### 2. Mount Security

**External Allowlist** - Mount permissions stored at `~/.config/nanoclaw/mount-allowlist.json`, which is:
- Outside project root
- Never mounted into containers
- Cannot be modified by agents

**Default Blocked Patterns:**
```
.ssh, .gnupg, .aws, .azure, .gcloud, .kube, .docker,
credentials, .env, .netrc, .npmrc, id_rsa, id_ed25519,
private_key, .secret
```

**Protections:**
- Symlink resolution before validation (prevents traversal attacks)
- Container path validation (rejects `..` and absolute paths)
- `nonMainReadOnly` option forces read-only for non-main groups

**Writable Main Project Root:**

The real project root is mounted read-write only in `operator` profile for the trusted main group. Non-main groups never receive the project root mount, and `safe` profile main groups do not receive it either.

### 3. Session Isolation

Each group has isolated Codex sessions at `data/sessions/{group}/.codex/`:
- Groups cannot see other groups' conversation history
- Session data includes full message history and file contents read
- Prevents cross-group information disclosure

### 4. IPC Authorization

Messages and task operations are verified against group identity:

| Operation | Main Group | Non-Main Group |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| Send message to own chat | ✓ | ✓ |
| Send message to other chats | ✓ | ✗ |
| Schedule task for self | ✓ | ✓ |
| Schedule task for others | ✓ | ✗ |
| View all tasks | ✓ | Own only |
| Manage other groups | ✓ | ✗ |

### 5. Credential Isolation

Containers should not receive real provider secrets through mounted files or the
project `.env`.

Current runtime behavior:
1. The host shadows the project `.env` mount with `/dev/null` for trusted main containers.
2. Per-group Codex state is mounted from `data/sessions/<group>/.codex/`, not from the project root.
3. The host/container boundary is responsible for any credential brokering needed by the local Codex/OneCLI setup.

The important guarantee for this repo is operational, not provider-specific:
- real secrets should stay on the host side
- containers should only receive the minimum auth material needed to run Codex
- secrets should never be exposed through repo files, group folders, or generic mounts

**NOT Mounted:**
- Channel auth sessions (`store/auth/`) - host only
- Mount allowlist - external, never mounted
- Any credentials matching blocked patterns
- `.env` is shadowed with `/dev/null` in the project root mount

## Privilege Comparison

| Capability | Main Group | Non-Main Group |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| Project root access | `/workspace/project` (rw) | None |
| Group folder | `/workspace/group` (rw) | `/workspace/group` (rw) |
| Global memory | Implicit via project | `/workspace/global` (ro) |
| Additional mounts | Configurable | Read-only unless allowed |
| Network access | Unrestricted | Unrestricted |
| MCP tools | All | All |
